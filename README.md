## ReChain

ReChain is a modified blockchain design that uses signature blocks to enforce blockchain
integrity rather than an expensive proof-of-work calculation. There is still a fixed
proof-of-work difficulty in order to stop many transactions from being executed at once.

Dependencies:
     * cxxopts.hpp
     * cereal
     * libcrypto++-dev
