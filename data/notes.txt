The most important things are:
	1. Changing the ref/sig of a Record breaks signatures. As far as I can tell,
	this does happen. Changing the reference directly breaks signatures and changes
	the hash of the block, invalidating both the reference and block hashes that
	a signature is carrying. This would force other blocks in the chain to be 
	re-hashed, which would break all signatures that refer to a Record after the 
	altered one. Re-signing a record changes the hash, doing all the same things,
	except that the reference on the signature is still valid- not that it matters.

	2. Calculating trust is accurate. Looks like this currently works, but I need
	large-scale tests. Trust is calculated in the following way:
		a. The genesis block is assumed to be correct.
		b. The public key on the genesis block (the 'owner') is given 1.0 'trust'
		c. For each signature record after that, half of the owner's 
		'trust' is given to the public keys that have signed the target Record.
		d. Once someone has been signed by the owner, they can also
		distribute half of their trust with each signature record
		they publish.
